	    			<h1>How Play Half-Left Potato</h1>
	    			<h2>Objective</h2>
	    			<p>
	    				You, Norman Fleeman, a Latvian scientist who has had a recent breakthrough in artificial potato cultivation, have been sent to the gulags by your oppressive government, know as the "Politiburo" (i.e. political bereau). The government tightly controls the food supply available to the public and your recent discovery could put a wrench (or crowbar) in the gears of their system. You have recently escaped from a Latvian gulag and must flee from the Politiburo police to your lab. There, you may continue your research and empower the people with easily grown potatos (so they no die of malnourish).
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
	    				In each of the 10 levels, there is a locked door or gate hindering your progress. You must currectly guess the passcode to the lock in order to proceed. Best be quick; the Politiburo police are hot on your trail and fire at will. Fortunately for you, growing up in the year-long winters of Latvia with little to eat provides one with an awfully hardy constitution, allowing you to endure several shots.
	    			</p>
	    			<h2>Display</h2>
	    			<p>
	    				On the game screen is a 10-key numerical keypad. You must use this keypad to enter the passcode into the smaller, black box. A message will let you know if your guess is correct or incorrect. If your guess is incorrect, the message will inform you to guess higher or lower. You will also be informed that your guess is either very close, close, far off, or very far off with the respective messages <b>"Cold", "Ice Cold", "Frigid", </b>and <b>"Latvian"</b> (Is Latvia. Is only cold). A list of the numbers you have chosen for the current level can be viewed in the larger, red box. You may press the "*" or "#" key to reveal the answer. When you guess correctly and move on to the next level, <b>you will have the same health, ammo, and items that you had in the previous level.</b>
	    			</p>
	    			<h2>Items</h2>
	    			<p>
	    				As you run towards the safe haven that is your lab, you will aquire various items to improve your chances of escape. 
	    			</p>
	    			<ul class="itemList">
	    				<li>
	    					<b>Pistol:</b> Fire Back! 2 free guesses per round per level. 1 free guess after level 5. 1 round is provided per level and for every lock opened in 5 of fewer guesses.
	    				</li>
	    				<li>
	    					<b>Health Pack:</b> 20+ health. 1 health pack is provided every even level and for every lock opened in 4 or fewer guesses.
	    				</li>
	    				<li>
	    					<b>Rock:</b> A staple in Latvia. 30+ health. Earn 1 per lock opened in 3 or fewer guesses.
	    				</li>
	    				<li>
	    					<b>SMG:</b> With all this spraying', you won't need prayin'! Get 3 free chances. These chances, unlike for the pistol, will roll over to other levels. Earn 1 per lock opened in just 1 guess.
	    				</li>
	    				<li>
	    					<b>Latvian Steel:</b> You've proven your mettle! Earned after surviving 3 straight levels with 50% or less health. When activated, you take half damage for the next 2 levels.
	    				</li>
